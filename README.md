Medieval Rush was inspired by old school computer games and aims to capture the (chaotic!) feeling of , when several friends would play against each other while sharing the same keyboard.

The objective of the game is to destroy all the enemy troops and conquer all enemy bases.

The game supports 2 to 3 players, with an experimental mode against a computer opponent (the AI can be temperamental, please refresh the game if not working initially).

This was my first game, created in my path to learn JavaScript. I hope you enjoy it half as much as I enjoyed making it!
